## Description of data files

**data per mountain region.csv:**: data frame listing the species diversity metrics and environmental factors for each mountain region following Rahbek et al. 2019.

**std_local richness_50gridcells.csv:**: 1000 replicates of a biogeographical null model, standardising the pattern of local species richness by sampling species from a coherent field of 50 grid cells.

**std_species turnover_50gridcells.csv:**: 1000 replicates of a biogeographical null model, standardising the pattern of species turnover by sampling species from a coherent field of 50 grid cells.

**std_regional species richness_50gridcells.csv:**: 1000 replicates of a biogeographical null model, standardising the pattern of regional species richness by sampling species from a coherent field of 50 grid cells.

**reference_raster.tif:**: Spatial raster containing reference id-values for each 0.25 degree grid cell in the World. Used for running the biogeographical null model
